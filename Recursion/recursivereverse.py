#Write a recursive function to reverse a string. 
#The base case occurs when the string is the empty string "".
#The recursive case involves appending the first character of 
#the string to the reversed tail of the string, where the tail
#is the string without the first character.

def reverse(s):
    # you write this part

    print(reverse("ward"))
